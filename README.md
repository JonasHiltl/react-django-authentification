# react-django-authentification
This is an App created with django and React.
The authentication is a JWT authentication 

1. You can create an Account with a custom user modal in Django.
   Password strenght gets estimated through the Zxcvbn library
2. Acivate the account through an E-mail link
3. Login an create access and refresh token

(Logout) functionality works but I couldn't implement it into the JSX
